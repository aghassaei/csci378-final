# CSCI 378 Final Project

## Goal
My goal is to implement Mancala. Mancala is a two-player strategy game. The board consists of 12 cups and two stores on either side. Below is an ASCI
representation of the board with each cup and store assigned an index:



    -----------------------------------------------------------
    |    |   12  |   11  |   10  |   09  |   08  |   07  |    |
    | 13 |-----------------------------------------------| 06 | 
    |    |   00  |   01  |   02  |   03  |   04  |   05  |    |
    -----------------------------------------------------------


Player 1 is assigned store 06 and player 2 is assigned store 13. Four stones are distributed in each cup to start.
## Rules of the game
1. 6 holes on each side. Each player has a mancala

    what you implemented and why you chose to implement that, and
    how well your implementation worked (and how you measured it).
